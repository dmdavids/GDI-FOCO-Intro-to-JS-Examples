GDI-FOCO-Intro-to-JS-Examples
=============================

Javascript and jQuery completed assignment examples for Girl Develop It FoCo Class on 1/10/15-1/11/15.

These can be used by the students if they need an example of each assignment.  
The assignments are progressive so I tried to keep all the work from the previous assignments in each one.
On Day 2, the AJAX assignments will need an api key for meetup.com added to them in order to work.
